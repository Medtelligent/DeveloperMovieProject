  "body": "## Developer Test Project\r\nCreate a basic ASP.NET/C# Web Forms application for a movie database. The application can be used in two modes - public and admin. The public mode is what a normal user would use to browse/search for movies stored in the database. The admin mode is for an authenticated user who can add/edit/delete movies in the database.\r\n\r\nThis project is meant to test overall familiarity of the developer using .NET technologies (web forms and MVC) as well as determine the comfort level of the developer with front-end coding through HTML/CSS/Javascript. Any clarifications needed are welcome. Once the project is complete, the result will be reviewed for:\r\n* Meeting all the requirements as set forth below\r\n* Code organization, quality and cleanliness\r\n* Use of any design patterns\r\n* Database design\r\n\r\nBased on the review, a code review session will be conducted with the candidate with any questions and feedback over a screen share or\r\nin-person.\r\n\r\n## Project Requirements\r\n### Public Mode\r\n* List movies categorized by genres on the main index page of the application\r\n* Movies in each genre should be the 5 recently added movies that genre\r\n* Click the genre to see all movies in that genre on a new page\r\n* Ability to search for movies by title. Entering text in search should suggest titles. This should be done through an API to provide the suggestions invoked using AJAX\r\n\r\n### Admin Mode\r\n* All admin pages should be secured by Forms login\r\n* Manage admin users\r\n* Manage list of genres\r\n* Ability to add/edit/delete movies\r\n\r\n## Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
